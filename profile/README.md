# <img src="https://github.com/HQT-Team/.github/blob/main/profile/imgs/logo.gif" width="3%"> WELCOME TO HQT TEAM :wave:

We are students from the 5th term of the Summer 2022 semester from FPT University HCM Campus. 

We are here, with a strong passion for programming, especially web programming, to create websites of a lifetime. Not only that, but we are also a team with talented members and full of laughter. 

Hopefully, our contributions will help inspire those who are passionate about programming in general and web programming in particular.
